The macaroni pasta is made in an onion-tomato masala and so the tangy taste of tomatoes is felt in the macaroni recipe. The recipe is not spicy and thus suitable for kids, but you can make it spicy by increasing the amount of red chili powder, black pepper powder and garam masala powder.
Apart from the spice powders, I have also added some dried mixed herbs (basil, thyme, oregano, parsley) in the macaroni. The addition of dried herbs simply elevates the entire flavor and taste of macaroni pasta. So do add them if you have dried herbs. Even fresh herbs can be added. You can also add your favorite dried herbs or fresh herbs.
